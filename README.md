https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

The data set contains information about movies and series on Netflix until mid-2021

## Questions & Conclusions:

In this project, I answered 6 business questions:

#### 1. What is the distribution of Netflix content?

It can be seen that distribution is about 30% of TV shows and about 70% of movies

#### 2. What is the most popular release year for movies on Netflix?

It can be seen that the years 2017 & 2018 are both the most popular release years for movies on Netflix.

#### 3. What year did Netflix add the most content to its platform?

It can be seen that in 2019 the most content was added to Netflix with a total of 2016 movies and TV shows. It is seen that every year the number of content increased until 2019 and in 2020 & 2021 there was a certain decrease in the amount of content, apparently because of the pandemic.

#### 4. Independent of the year, what is the most popular month to add content?

It is seen that the most popular months for adding content are June and December. A possible explanation is that June is the beginning of summer and December is before Christmas and these are months when people have more time to watch new content.

#### 5. What is the movie with the longest title in the dataset?

Long title: Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond - Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton. Length: 104.

#### 6. Which actor/actress shows up most frequently in the Netflix dataset?
It can be seen that Anupam Kher is the actor that shows up most frequently in the Netflix dataset with 43 movies/TV shows.
